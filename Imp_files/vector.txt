1. Quantities thar are described using magitude and direction are called vector quantities and quantities that are described by only their
   magnitude are called scalar quantities.

2. Mathematically, a quantity that has both magnitude and direction is called vector 

3. Example for scalar quantities -> Speed , Distance ,Temperature which can entirely be measured by numerical values.

4. Example for vector quantitiy -> Velocity. Ex: 30km/hr towards north.
